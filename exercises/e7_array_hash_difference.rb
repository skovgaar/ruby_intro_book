an array is an ordered list that can contain any number of data-types,
even other arrays. it is ordered by an index which starts at 0
a hash is an associative data-structure which contains key-value pairs.
prior to Ruby 1.9 it was not guarenteed that order of a hash would
be maintained, but it is, however, after 1.9.
access of arrays happen by the index arr[0] fx
acces of a hash happen by the key hash[:name] fx
=end

# solution
# The major difference between an array and a hash is that a hash contains a key value pair for referencing by key.
